# PhD Project Directory Structure

This repository contains the file structure for my PhD projects. 
## Overall Structure

The root directory, `wnv-foco_gen_epi_v2`, contains all my PhD work pertaining to the WNV Genomic Epidemiology.  The key subdirectories are:

*   **`0_data_preprocessing/`, `1_local_diversity/`, `2_introduction/`, `3_persistence/` (and subsequent project folders):**  These directories contain individual projects. Each project has a consistent internal structure (described below).
*   **`core/`:** Contains code, configuration files, documentation, pipelines, and utility scripts that are shared across multiple projects.
*   **`data/`:**  This directory serves as a central repository for data that is *truly shared* across *all* projects.  Its use should be minimized; most project-specific data should reside within the project's own `data` folder.

## Project Structure

Each project directory (e.g., `0_data_preprocessing`) follows this structure:

*   **`README.md`:** This file (the one you're reading now!) provides information about the specific project.
*   **`code/`:** Contains all the scripts and code related to the project.
*   **`envs/`:** Stores environment files (e.g., conda environment specifications, Dockerfiles) used for the project.  This helps ensure reproducibility.
*   **`results/`:** Stores the results generated by the project's code.
*   **`data/`:** This is the *most important* directory for each project. It contains all the data used by the project, organized as follows:
    *   **`processed/`:** Contains processed or derived data.
    *   **`raw/`:** Contains the original, unprocessed data.
    *   **`references/`:** Contains any project-specific reference data (if needed).

## Central Data Repository (`data/`)

The root-level `data` directory is for data that is genuinely shared across *all* projects.  It is organized as follows:

*   **`external_datasets/`:** Datasets downloaded from external sources.
*   **`reference_genomes/`:** Reference genomes and related files.
    *   **`annotations/`:** Genome annotations.
    *   **`indices/`:** Genome indices.
    *   **(Other relevant subfolders)**
*   **`scripts/`:** Scripts for managing the central data (e.g., downloading, converting, preprocessing shared data).

## Workflow

1.  **New Project:** When starting a new project (e.g., `4_new_project`), create the project directory and its subdirectories (`code/`, `envs/`, `results/`, `data/`).

2.  **Data Acquisition:**  If the project requires data from the central repository, copy or link the necessary files to the project's `data` folder. *Avoid directly working with data in the central repository from your project code.* This maintains data provenance and reproducibility.

3.  **Project Data:** All project-specific data (raw, processed, results) should be stored within the project's `data` folder.

4.  **Version Control (Git):**  It is highly recommended to use Git to track changes to your code and data within each project directory.

## Rationale

This structure promotes:

*   **Reproducibility:**  Clearly defined data and code paths make it easier to reproduce results.
*   **Organization:**  Data and code are logically grouped, making it easier to navigate and manage projects.
*   **Collaboration:**  A consistent structure makes it easier for others to understand and contribute to the work.
*   **Data Integrity:**  Separating project-specific data helps prevent accidental modification or deletion of shared data.

By following this structure, I aim to maintain a well-organized and reproducible workflow throughout my PhD.
